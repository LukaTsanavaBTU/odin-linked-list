# Linked List

Made for The Odin Project.
The purpose of this project was to implement linked lists using plain JavaScript. There are two files: Node.js containing a class representing a node in the linked list; LinkedList.js containing a class representing the linked list itself. For the linked list class, I've implemented several methods and properties:

- **append(value)**: add a new node at the end of the list;
- **prepend(value)**: add a new node at the start of the list;
- **size**: the size of the entire list;
- **head**: the first node of the list;
- **tail**: the last node of the list;
- **at(index)**: returns the node at the given index (also accepts negative indices);
- **pop()**: removes the last node in the list and returns its value;
- **contains(value)**: returns true if the value exists in the list and false if it doesn't;
- **find(value)**: returns the index of the value if it exists in the list and null if it doesn't;
- **toString()**: returns the list in a string format. Example: ( value ) -> ( value ) -> ( value ) -> null;
- **insertAt(value, index)**: insert a new node at the given index (also accepts negative indices);
- **removeAt(index)**: remove a node at the given index (also accepts negative indices).

The main goal of the project was to get some practice with data structures and with js.
